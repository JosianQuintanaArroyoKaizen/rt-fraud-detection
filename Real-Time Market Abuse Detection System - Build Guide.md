# Real-Time Market Abuse Detection System: Production-Grade Build Guide v3

**Addressing the Core Challenge: Unlabeled Transaction Data**

**Target Achievement:** Process 10,000 transactions/second with 85-92% recall using hybrid approach (synthetic training + transfer learning + anomaly detection) for market abuse surveillance with unlabeled real-world data.

**Timeline:** 4 weeks | **Budget:** ~$100/month | **Status:** Production-grade system with custom IaC

**Python Version:** 3.12 (all components compatible)

---

## Executive Summary

This project demonstrates enterprise-grade ML engineering skills by building a serverless market abuse detection system that addresses the **real-world problem of unlabeled transaction data** - a challenge every financial institution faces.

**The Challenge:**
- You have MiFID II transaction data (potentially millions of records)
- You DON'T have labels indicating which transactions are manipulative
- Pre-labeled datasets don't exist for your specific data
- You need a working surveillance system anyway

**The Solution: Three-Phase Hybrid Approach**

**Phase 1 - Supervised Learning on Synthetic (Week 1-2):**
- Generate labeled synthetic MiFID II transactions matching your real data schema
- Train XGBoost on known manipulation patterns (spoofing, wash trading, layering)
- Achieve 95%+ recall on synthetic test set
- Build feature engineering that works on both synthetic and real data

**Phase 2 - Transfer Learning to Real Data (Week 3):**
- Apply synthetic-trained models to your unlabeled real transactions
- Flag suspicious patterns learned from synthetic data
- Train LSTM-Autoencoder on normal real transactions only (unsupervised)
- Detect novel anomalies not present in synthetic training data

**Phase 3 - Active Learning Pipeline (Week 4):**
- Expert reviews top-flagged suspicious transactions
- Create high-quality labels for real cases
- Retrain models combining synthetic + manually labeled real data
- Iterative improvement cycle

**Key Differentiator:** This is NOT a tutorial using pre-labeled datasets. This demonstrates how financial institutions actually build surveillance systems when ground truth is unknown - the most valuable and realistic scenario.

**Technical Infrastructure:**
- Processes **10,000 transactions/second** with sub-15ms P99 latency
- Achieves **85-92% recall** through hybrid approach (estimated on real unlabeled data)
- Detects **both known patterns** (via synthetic training) and **novel schemes** (via anomaly detection)
- Costs **<$100/month** through serverless architecture
- Uses **production patterns**: IaC, CI/CD, monitoring, explainability

**Architecture Remains Unchanged from v2:**
- Same serverless infrastructure (Lambda, Kinesis, DynamoDB, S3)
- Same performance targets (10K TPS, <15ms latency)
- Same ML stack (XGBoost, LSTM-Autoencoder, SHAP)
- Same IaC approach (CloudFormation or CDK)

**What Changes:**
- Data generation strategy (synthetic MiFID II instead of IBM AMLSim)
- Training approach (synthetic → transfer → active learning)
- Evaluation methodology (no ground truth for real data initially)

---

## Technology Stack & Rationale

### Core Infrastructure (UNCHANGED)
- **Kinesis Data Streams**: 10K TPS = 3 shards (each shard = 1K records/sec)
- **Lambda (Container Images)**: Serverless inference, sub-10ms latency, auto-scaling
- **ECS Fargate**: Training infrastructure (GPU support, isolated compute)
- **Step Functions**: Training pipeline orchestration
- **DynamoDB**: Real-time fraud scores (<5ms lookups)
- **S3**: Data lake (transaction history, model artifacts, training data)
- **Athena**: SQL analytics on S3 data

### ML Stack (UPDATED APPROACH)
- **XGBoost**: Supervised learning for known fraud patterns - **trained on synthetic labeled data**
- **LSTM-Autoencoder**: Unsupervised anomaly detection - **trained on real normal transactions**
- **SHAP**: Model explainability (regulatory requirement)
- **Synthetic MiFID II Generator**: Custom generator matching your real data schema

### DevOps & Monitoring (UNCHANGED)
- **CloudFormation or CDK**: Infrastructure as Code
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline
- **CloudWatch + X-Ray**: Monitoring and distributed tracing
- **MLflow**: Experiment tracking and model registry
- **Docker**: Containerized training and inference

**Python Version:** All Lambda functions use Python 3.12 runtime

## The Unlabeled Data Challenge: Why This Matters

### Real-World Reality

**What Financial Institutions Actually Face:**
- MiFID II transaction reports: millions of records daily
- No labels indicating which are manipulative
- Historical enforcement actions: too few to train on
- Expert knowledge exists but isn't encoded in data

**Traditional Approaches Fail:**
- Pure unsupervised learning: 70-80% recall, 20%+ false positive rate
- Rule-based systems: 99.99% false positive rate (PwC 2019 survey)
- Manual review: impossible at scale (30M reports/day to UK FCA alone)

**Your Hybrid Approach Succeeds:**
- Synthetic data provides perfect labels for training
- Transfer learning applies patterns to real data
- Anomaly detection catches novel schemes
- Active learning iteratively improves with expert feedback

**Interview Value:**
This demonstrates understanding of THE core challenge in surveillance. Anyone can train on pre-labeled Kaggle data. Building systems when labels don't exist shows real-world production expertise.

## Minimal MiFID II Schema for Implementation

You don't need all 65 MiFID II fields. Start with **core 20-25 fields** that match your actual data:

### Critical Fields (Must Have)

**Identification:**
- transaction_id: Unique identifier
- timestamp: Execution datetime with microsecond precision
- instrument_id: ISIN or internal security identifier
- trading_venue: Exchange/venue MIC code

**Trading Details:**
- price: Execution price (in major currency)
- quantity: Transaction size
- side: BUY or SELL
- order_type: MARKET, LIMIT, STOP

**Participant Identification:**
- trader_id: LEI or anonymized trader identifier
- counterparty_id: Other side of trade (for wash trading detection)

### High Priority Fields (Should Have)

**Behavioral Indicators:**
- is_algo_trade: Algorithm execution flag
- is_hft: High-frequency trading flag
- order_id: Link to order lifecycle
- order_status: EXECUTED, CANCELLED, MODIFIED

### Medium Priority Fields (Nice to Have)

**Order Book Context:**
- bid_price: Best bid at execution
- ask_price: Best ask at execution
- bid_size: Depth at best bid
- ask_size: Depth at best ask

### Derived Fields (Calculate from Above)

**Temporal:**
- hour_of_day: 0-23
- day_of_week: 0-6
- is_business_hours: Boolean
- seconds_since_market_open: Intraday position

**Network:**
- trader_transaction_count_24h: Velocity
- counterparty_relationship_score: How often they trade together

---

## 4-Week Implementation Plan

```

**Week 1 Workflow:**

**Day 1-2: Real Data Audit (Critical)**
- Load your real MiFID II transaction data
- Run automated audit script to inventory all fields
- Identify which critical fields exist
- Document data quality (null rates, data types)
- Generate field coverage report

**Audit Process:**
Run real_data_auditor.py on your data. It will output:
- Total number of transactions
- All available fields with data types
- Null percentage per field
- Suggested mappings to standard MiFID II schema
- Critical field availability checklist

**Day 3-4: Synthetic Data Generation**
- Configure synthetic generator to match YOUR schema
- Generate 90,000 normal transactions
- Inject 10% manipulation patterns (spoofing, wash trading, layering)
- Total: 100,000 labeled synthetic transactions
- Split: 70% train, 15% validation, 15% test

**Manipulation Patterns in Synthetic:**

**Spoofing (5% of data):**
- Large fake orders on one side
- Quick cancellation
- Real execution on opposite side
- Clear labels: is_manipulation=True, type=SPOOFING

**Wash Trading (3% of data):**
- Matched buy/sell between controlled accounts
- Same price, same size, same timestamp
- Counterparty relationship pattern
- Clear labels: is_manipulation=True, type=WASH_TRADING

**Layering (2% of data):**
- Multiple orders at different price levels
- All cancelled except one real trade
- Clear labels: is_manipulation=True, type=LAYERING

**Day 5: Schema Mapping**
- Create schema_mapping.json file
- Map each real field name to synthetic field name
- Handle missing fields (use defaults or derived values)
- Test transformation on sample data

**Example Mapping Structure:**
```
{
  "transaction_id": "trade_reference_number",
  "timestamp": "execution_timestamp", 
  "instrument_id": "isin_code",
  "trader_id": "investment_firm_lei",
  "price": "execution_price"
}
```

```

**Week 3 Workflow:**

**Day 1-2: Transfer Learning - Apply Synthetic Model to Real Data**

**Process:**
- Load your real unlabeled MiFID II data
- Transform via schema mapper to match synthetic format
- Extract features (same feature engineering as Week 2)
- Score all real transactions using synthetic-trained XGBoost
- Generate suspicion scores (0-1 probability)

**Key Insight:**
Model trained on synthetic data will recognize patterns in real data IF:
- Synthetic patterns are realistic
- Feature engineering is consistent
- Real manipulation follows similar dynamics to synthetic

**Expected Behavior:**
- Most real transactions score low (<0.3) - likely normal
- Some transactions score high (>0.7) - suspicious, need review
- Flag rate: expect 2-10% depending on your data quality

**Output:**
Every real transaction now has:
- synthetic_model_score: 0-1 probability
- flagged_by_synthetic: Boolean (score > 0.7)
- top_features_contributing: SHAP values

**Day 3-4: Train LSTM-Autoencoder on Real Normal Data**

**Strategy:**
Assume most transactions are normal (reasonable in real markets). Train autoencoder to reconstruct NORMAL behavior, then flag anything that can't be reconstructed well.

**Process:**
- Select "likely normal" transactions from real data
- Filter: synthetic_model_score < 0.3 (low suspicion from XGBoost)
- This gives you ~90-95% of real data assumed normal
- Train LSTM-Autoencoder on these normal transactions ONLY
- Model learns what "normal trading" looks like in YOUR data

**LSTM-Autoencoder Architecture:**
- Encoder: LSTM layers compress transaction sequence
- Latent representation: 16-dimensional bottleneck
- Decoder: LSTM layers reconstruct sequence
- Training: Minimize reconstruction error on normal data only

**Training Infrastructure:**
- ECS Fargate with GPU (g4dn.xlarge)
- Training time: 2-4 hours
- Epochs: 100-200
- Early stopping on validation reconstruction error

**Inference Logic:**
- High reconstruction error = Unusual transaction = Potential manipulation
- Low reconstruction error = Looks normal = Probably benign

**Day 5: Hybrid Ensemble Implementation**

**Combine Two Complementary Approaches:**

**XGBoost (Synthetic-trained):**
- Strength: Recognizes KNOWN manipulation patterns
- Weakness: Misses novel schemes not in synthetic data
- Weight in ensemble: 60%

**LSTM-Autoencoder (Real-trained):**
- Strength: Detects NOVEL anomalies
- Weakness: Can flag benign unusual behavior
- Weight in ensemble: 40%

**Ensemble Logic:**
- If XGBoost score high: Known pattern detected
- If Autoencoder score high: Novel anomaly detected
- If BOTH high: Very suspicious, high priority
- Final score: 0.6 × XGBoost + 0.4 × Autoencoder

**Ensemble Benefits:**
- Catches both known and unknown manipulation
- Reduces false positives (agreement between models)
- Provides richer explanations (which model triggered)

**Day 6-7: Flag Selection and Review Queue**

**Active Learning Setup:**
- Sort all real transactions by final ensemble score
- Select TOP 100-200 highest scoring transactions
- Export to review queue with all context:
  - Transaction details
  - Ensemble score breakdown
  - SHAP explanations from both models
  - Historical behavior of trader
  - Network connections

**Review Queue Format:**
Export CSV or dashboard with columns:
- transaction_id
- timestamp
- trader_id
- instrument_id
- price, quantity, side
- ensemble_score
- xgboost_score
- autoencoder_score
- detection_reason (known pattern or novel anomaly)
- top_5_suspicious_features
- requires_manual_review (Boolean)

**Success Metrics Week 3:**
- Synthetic-trained XGBoost applied to all real data
- LSTM-Autoencoder trained on real normal transactions
- Hybrid ensemble combining both models
- Top 100-200 suspicious cases flagged for manual review
- Review queue exported with full context
- Both models deployed to Lambda with <15ms combined latency

**AWS Cost Week 3:** ~$40 (GPU Fargate for LSTM training, Lambda invocations)

```

**Week 4 Workflow:**

**Day 1-2: Manual Review and Labeling**

**Review Process:**
Expert (you or domain specialist) reviews top 100 flagged transactions:

For each flagged transaction, determine:
- Is this actually manipulation? (Yes/No)
- If yes, what type? (Spoofing, Wash Trading, Layering, Other)
- Confidence level? (High/Medium/Low)
- Notes: Why is this suspicious or not?

**Labeling Workflow:**
- Load review queue CSV
- For each case:
  - Examine transaction details
  - Check trader's historical behavior
  - Look for manipulation patterns
  - Review SHAP explanations (do they make sense?)
  - Make decision: manipulation or false positive
- Add columns: is_manipulation, manipulation_type, confidence, notes
- Save as labeled dataset

**Expected Outcomes:**
Out of 100 reviewed cases, typical findings:
- 60-80 are TRUE positives (actual manipulation)
- 20-40 are FALSE positives (unusual but legitimate)

This is NORMAL. Models trained on synthetic data aren't perfect on real data initially.

**Day 3: Model Retraining with Real Labels**

**Retraining Strategy:**
Combine three data sources:
- 100,000 synthetic labeled transactions (Week 2)
- 100 manually labeled real transactions (Week 4)
- Give real labels higher weight (more valuable)

**Training Configuration:**
- XGBoost with sample weights
- Synthetic examples: weight = 1.0
- Real labeled examples: weight = 5.0
- This tells model to prioritize real labels

**Expected Improvement:**
Model v1 (synthetic only): ~70-85% estimated recall on real
Model v2 (synthetic + 100 real): ~80-90% estimated recall on real

**Version Control:**
- Model v1 saved as: models/xgboost_v1_synthetic_only.json
- Model v2 saved as: models/xgboost_v2_synthetic_plus_real.json
- Track in MLflow with metrics, parameters, data provenance

### Performance Expectations: The Reality of Unlabeled Data

**Synthetic Test Set (Week 2):**
- Recall: 95-98%
- Precision: 92-96%
- AUC-ROC: 0.98+
- This is HIGH because we have perfect labels

**Real Data Initial Application (Week 3):**
- Estimated Recall: 70-85% (unknown, no labels)
- Estimated Precision: 60-75%
- Flag rate: 2-10% of transactions
- Many false positives expected initially

**After Active Learning - Iteration 2 (Week 4):**
- Estimated Recall: 80-90%
- Estimated Precision: 70-80%
- Flag rate: 3-7%
- Improving as real labels accumulate

**Long-term (6-12 months, 1000+ real labels):**
- Estimated Recall: 90-95%
- Estimated Precision: 85-92%
- Flag rate: 2-5%
- System converged to optimal for your data

**Key Insight:**
You CANNOT report exact recall/precision on real data because you don't have ground truth. Report estimated ranges based on:
- Synthetic performance (upper bound)
- Manual review outcomes (sample-based estimate)
- Expert judgment of flagged cases

### Throughput

**Target:** 10,000 transactions/second sustained

**Measurement:**
CloudWatch metric: TransactionsPerSecond
- Real-time dashboard
- Track P50, P95, P99 over 1-hour windows
- Alert if drops below 8,000 TPS

**Proof:**
Dashboard screenshot showing sustained 10K TPS over 8+ hours

### Latency

**Target:** P99 < 15ms end-to-end

**Breakdown:**
- Feature engineering: 2-3ms
- XGBoost inference: 3-5ms
- LSTM-AE inference: 5-8ms
- Ensemble aggregation: 1ms
- DynamoDB write: 2-3ms
- Total P99: 13-15ms

**Measurement:**
X-Ray distributed tracing with detailed breakdown per Lambda invocation

**Proof:**
X-Ray trace visualization showing latency distribution

### Detection Performance

**Target (Synthetic):** 95%+ recall
**Target (Real, Estimated):** 85-92% recall after active learning

**Measurement Strategy:**

**Synthetic Test Set:**
Standard ML evaluation with held-out test set:
- Confusion matrix
- ROC curve
- Precision-Recall curve
- Feature importance

**Real Data:**
Cannot measure directly (no labels). Estimate via:
- Manual review outcomes: X% of flagged cases confirmed as manipulation
- Expert confidence: Domain specialist judgment on detection quality
- Comparative baselines: Better than rule-based system (99% FP rate)

**Reporting Language:**
"Achieves 95% recall on synthetic labeled test set. Applied to real unlabeled data with estimated 85-92% recall based on expert review of flagged cases, representing significant improvement over rule-based alternatives (99.99% false positive rate per PwC 2019)."

### Cost Efficiency

**Target:** <$100/month for 10K TPS

**Component Breakdown:**
- Kinesis: 3 shards × $32.40/month
- Lambda: ~259M invocations × $50/month

## The Unlabeled Data Advantage: Why This is Better

### Interview Talking Points

**Technical Depth:**
"I built a hybrid market abuse detection system that addresses the real-world challenge of unlabeled transaction data. The system uses a three-phase approach: first, I generate labeled synthetic MiFID II transactions matching my real data schema and train an XGBoost model achieving 95% recall. Second, I apply transfer learning to real unlabeled data while training an LSTM-Autoencoder on normal transactions for anomaly detection. Third, I implement active learning where experts review top-flagged cases, creating high-quality labels that iteratively improve the model from estimated 70-85% to 90%+ recall over time."

**Real-World Problem Solving:**
"Unlike projects using pre-labeled Kaggle datasets, this demonstrates how financial institutions actually build surveillance systems. The FCA receives 30 million transaction reports daily with no labels indicating manipulation. My approach mirrors production workflows: train on synthetic to learn patterns, transfer to real data, detect anomalies in normal behavior, and iteratively improve through expert feedback."

**Production Engineering:**
"The system processes 10,000 transactions per second with sub-15ms P99 latency using serverless Lambda containers. I built the inference layer with Python 3.12, deployed via custom CloudFormation IaC, implemented CI/CD with GitHub Actions, and comprehensive monitoring with CloudWatch and X-Ray. The hybrid ensemble combines supervised learning (synthetic-trained XGBoost) and unsupervised learning (LSTM-Autoencoder on real data) to catch both known and novel manipulation schemes."

**Business Impact:**
"The hybrid approach catches manipulation that pure supervised learning misses. The LSTM-Autoencoder detects approximately 15-20% of cases that XGBoost alone would miss because these are novel patterns not in the synthetic training data. After 100 manually labeled cases, the system improves from estimated 75% to 90% recall. The active learning pipeline means performance continuously improves as more real cases are reviewed, eventually converging to optimal detection for the specific data distribution."

**Market Abuse Focus:**
"I prioritized features critical for market surveillance: order cancellation ratios for spoofing detection, counterparty relationship patterns for wash trading, temporal velocity metrics, and network analysis. The system provides SHAP explainability for every alert to satisfy MAR and MiFID II compliance requirements. The sub-15ms latency enables real-time trade blocking before settlement."

- Detailed write-up on transfer learning results
- Blog post: "Building Market Abuse Detection Without Labels"
- Cost analysis showing <$100/month at scale

### Demo Script (3-4 Minutes)

**1. Problem Statement (45 seconds):**
"Market abuse surveillance faces a fundamental challenge: we have millions of MiFID II transaction reports but no labels indicating which are manipulative. Traditional approaches fail - rule-based systems have 99.99% false positive rates, making them operationally useless. My system solves this using a hybrid approach combining synthetic training data, transfer learning, and active learning."

**2. Architecture Overview (60 seconds):**
"The system processes 10,000 transactions per second using serverless Lambda containers on AWS. Here's the data flow: [show architecture diagram]
- Phase 1: Generate labeled synthetic MiFID II data matching my real schema, train XGBoost achieving 95% recall
- Phase 2: Apply synthetic-trained model to real unlabeled data via transfer learning
- Phase 3: Train LSTM-Autoencoder on real normal transactions for anomaly detection
- Phase 4: Hybrid ensemble combines both models, flags top suspicious cases for expert review"

**3. Live Demo (90 seconds):**
[Open CloudWatch Dashboard]
"Here's the system running live, processing 10K transactions per second."

[Show model application]
"I'll send a test transaction through the pipeline..."
[Show transaction details, ensemble score, SHAP explanation]

"The transaction is flagged with 0.87 suspicion score. The XGBoost component detected it matches spoofing patterns learned from synthetic data (high order cancellation ratio). The LSTM-Autoencoder flagged it as anomalous compared to normal behavior. SHAP values show the top contributing features: unusual timing, high cancel ratio, and counterparty pattern."

[Show performance metrics]
"Latency breakdown: 3ms feature engineering, 5ms XGBoost, 7ms autoencoder, total 15ms P99."

**4. Active Learning Impact (45 seconds):**
"After manually labeling 100 flagged cases and retraining, estimated recall improved from 75% to 88%. Here's the iteration tracker showing improvement over 4 weeks. The system continues learning from expert feedback, converging toward optimal performance on our specific data distribution. This is exactly how financial institutions build surveillance when ground truth doesn't exist."

## Risk Mitigation & Common Issues

### Challenge 1: Synthetic Patterns Don't Match Real Manipulation

**Symptom:**
Flag rate on real data is either too high (>20%) or too low (<1%)

**Solution:**
- Review flagged cases with domain expert
- Refine synthetic generator to match real patterns observed
- Adjust ensemble weights (favor autoencoder if synthetic is off)
- Collect more real labels quickly via active learning

### Challenge 2: LSTM-Autoencoder Flags Too Much

**Symptom:**
Everything looks "anomalous" to autoencoder, high false positives

**Solution:**
- Increase size of normal training set
- Adjust reconstruction error threshold (calibrate on validation set)
- Add regularization to prevent overfitting to noise
- Consider training separate autoencoders per instrument or trader type

### Challenge 3: Transfer Learning Performs Poorly

**Symptom:**
Synthetic-trained model has low confidence on all real data

**Solution:**
- Check schema mapping (are fields transformed correctly?)
- Verify feature distributions match (synthetic vs real)
- Add domain adaptation techniques
- Prioritize active learning to get real labels quickly

### Challenge 4: Can't Achieve 10K TPS

**Symptom:**
Kinesis throttling or Lambda concurrency limits

**Solution:**
- Increase Kinesis shards (each handles 1K/sec)
- Increase Lambda reserved concurrency
- Use Lambda SnapStart to reduce cold starts
- Optimize feature engineering (batch operations)

### Challenge 5: Cost Exceeds Budget

**Symptom:**
Monthly cost >$100

**Solution:**
- Reduce Kinesis retention period (7 days → 1 day)
- Use Kinesis Data Firehose for direct S3 writes
- Implement DynamoDB auto-scaling down during low traffic
- Reduce CloudWatch log retention
- Optimize Lambda memory allocation

### Challenge 6: Manual Review Bottleneck

**Symptom:**
100 cases take too long to review

**Solution:**
- Build simple web UI for faster labeling
- Start with smaller batches (50 cases)
- Focus on highest confidence flags first
- Involve multiple reviewers to share load
- Use SHAP explanations to speed up review

---

## Fast-Track Option (Tight Deadlines)

If you have less than 4 weeks, prioritize:

**Week 1: Foundation**
- Real data audit + schema mapping
- Synthetic generation (focus on one manipulation type: spoofing)
- Infrastructure setup
- Data flow working at 10K TPS

**Week 2: Single Model**
- XGBoost on synthetic only
- Skip LSTM-Autoencoder initially
- Deploy to Lambda
- Apply to real data

**Week 3: Iteration**
- Review top 50 flagged cases
- Manual labeling
- Retrain with real labels
- Basic monitoring

**Week 4: Documentation**
- Professional README
- Architecture diagram
- Performance metrics
- Demo preparation

**Then iterate:**
Add LSTM-Autoencoder and advanced features after initial system is working.
